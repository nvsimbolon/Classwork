-- Question 1
-- There are 7 tables in this dataset.


-- Question 2
-- a.) I can see only 2 out of the 3 possible relationships in this database: one-to-one and one-to-many
-- b.) Examples:
--          - One-to-one: Country and league tables
--          - One-to-many: Match, country, and league tables
-- c.) One-to-one:
--          - Country & league; primary key - "id", foreign_key - "country_id"
--     One-to-Many:
--          - Match & country & league; primary key - "id", foreign_keys - "country_id" & "league_id"


-- Question 3
SELECT Count(player_name) AS num_of_players
FROM player;
-- There are 11060 players in the database.

SELECT Count(id) AS num_of_teams
FROM team;
-- There are 299 teams in the database.

SELECT c.name AS Country, l.name
FROM country AS c
INNER JOIN league AS l
ON c.id = l.country_id;
-- There are 11 countries in the database.

SELECT DISTINCT(season) AS seasons
FROM match;
-- There are 8 seasons in the database.


-- Question 4
SELECT home_team_api_id, COUNT(home_team_api_id) AS home_team_wins, l.name AS league
FROM match AS m
INNER JOIN league AS l
ON m.league_id = l.id
WHERE m.home_team_goal > m.away_team_goal
GROUP BY league;

SELECT home_team_api_id, COUNT(home_team_api_id) AS all_games, l.name AS league
FROM match AS m
INNER JOIN league AS l
ON m.league_id = l.id
GROUP BY league;
-- In order to calculate the home court advantage, I imported the newly created columns "home_team_wins" and 
-- "all_games" from sqlite into a Google Sheet. I then divided the number of "home_team_wins" by "all_games"
-- per league. The Spanish league "Spain LIGA BBVA" has the strongest home court advantage according to my
-- calculations.


-- Question 5a
SELECT season, AVG(home_team_goal & away_team_goal) AS average_goals, MAX(home_team_goal & away_team_goal) AS max_goals
FROM match
GROUP BY season;
-- It appears as if there has not been a significant change over the seasons. The count of max_goals seems to hover
-- around 4 and the average_goals seems to hover around 41% - 42%. Overall, the change over the years seems a bit
-- negligible.

-- Question 5b
SELECT strftime('%Y %m', date) AS month, AVG(home_team_goal & away_team_goal) AS average_goals
FROM match
GROUP BY month;
-- In respect to a possible weather effect, it appears that over the number of months and years, there is a slight
-- increase in the average number of goals scored per game (from 0.14 in 07/2008 to 0.516 in 05/2016).


-- Question 6a
CREATE TABLE rating AS
    SELECT player_api_id, MAX(overall_rating) AS overall_rating, season
    FROM player_attributes AS p
    INNER JOIN match AS m
    ON p.date = m.date
    GROUP BY season;
    
SELECT r.season, player_name
FROM rating AS r
INNER JOIN player AS p
ON r.player_api_id = p.player_api_id;
-- Yes, Lionel Messi is rated the best for more than one season (6 seasons in a row actually).

-- Question 6b
CREATE TABLE gk_rating AS
    SELECT player_api_id, AVG(gk_diving & gk_handling & gk_kicking & gk_positioning & gk_reflexes) AS gk, season
    FROM player_attributes AS p
    INNER JOIN match AS m
    ON p.date = m.date
    GROUP BY season;
    
SELECT g.season, player_name
FROM gk_rating AS g
INNER JOIN player AS p
ON g.player_api_id = p.player_api_id;
-- Only two goalkeepers appear and Aaron Cresswell appears the most (6 seasons in a row!).


-- Question 7
SELECT (2016 - strftime('%Y', p.birthday)) AS age, AVG(a.overall_rating) AS average_rating, MAX(a.overall_rating) AS max_rating
FROM player AS p
INNER JOIN player_attributes AS a
ON p.player_api_id = a.player_api_id
GROUP BY age;
-- Highest Overall Average: 48 (79.5 average rating)
-- Highest Overall Maximum: 29 (94 max rating)
